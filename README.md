Google Africa Developer Scholarship (Phase II) Practice Project

Description

During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program are encouraged to explore the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.

Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight. Learners in the Cloud track have free access to a selection of fundamental labs on GCP.
